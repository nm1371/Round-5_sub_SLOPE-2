# Round-5_sub_SLOPE-2 code is associated to find  a feasible solution of the underdetermind linear system equations with bounded variables, that is,
find V
s.t. SV=0,
     L<V<U.
Please set your file name, your sheet and your data range for matrix S on lines 6-8.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix L on the line 17.
Please set  your data range for lower bound matrix U on the line 24.
